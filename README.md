PotionProtect
=============

Let your users protect their own land using PotionProtect!

Using PotionProtect, users can simply cast a potion you define and a region of a certain size is generated, centered on the player that cast the potion!
You can integrate PotionProtect with your existing WorldGuard regions or use the built-in region system. (Please note: It is recommended to use WorldGuard until the region manager is more developed!)
